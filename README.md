# DevOps-Pathway

‚ö†Ô∏èThis is advise to myself‚ö†Ô∏è

As an aspiring Cloud/ DevOps Engineer. I will be following the pathway below. This is based on the most in-demand Technologies. 

As a Beginner I will be be starting with the following:

 - Linux 
 - Git Fundamentals
 - Python or GoLang
 - One cloud provider to a basic level - AWS, Azure or GCP.

Once completing the basic fundamentals I will then proceed onto advanced Technologies such as:

 - Infrastructure-as-code - Terraform 
 - Containers (Docker & Kubernetes)
 - Understanding of Ansible (another Infrastructure-as-code tool)
 - Continuous integration & Continuous deployment - CI/CD
 - Overall understanding of Security.

Please see resources to learn the above üëÜüèΩ
